# Cozy Films
A films web app where users can browse through a catalog of comfort films and authenticate to add their own or make reviews. 

This is part of a full stack (MERN) project of my own, using React for its front end, Node and Express for its backend and MongoDB as its database.

Note: Please bear in mind that the Cozy Films API is currently being hosted on a free service, thus it takes a little longer than usual to load initially. After the first load everything should run smoothly.
